The following steps should be taken to replicate the analysis. The R scripts corresponding to a step start with the number of the step. For example, for data preparation there are four scripts starting with "1" that should be run to apply this step 
1.	Data preparation
2.	Missing data simulation
3.	Computations of the target estimands
4.	Imputations
5.	Transformation of the data for computations of estimators
6.	Computation of the estimators
7.	Computation of the performance measures
8.	Generation of the plots
